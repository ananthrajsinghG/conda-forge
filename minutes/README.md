A directory containing the minutes from previous dev meetings.
These meetings occur every two weeks on Wednesday from 17:30-18:00 UTC.
A link to the google calendar item can be found [here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=dGozZTc1NjhvcmY1cTh1Nm85ODJhZXBibWNfMjAxOTA3MTFUMTUwMDAwWiBlZGlsbEBhbmFjb25kYS5jb20&tmsrc=edill%40anaconda.com).

We use https://hackmd.io/ for taking meeting minutes and will upload the resultant markdown file to this "./minutes" folder after the meeting has concluded.

There is a template provided that you should consider using to create a new hackmd document.
