<h2>Transferring to conda-forge<a class="headerlink" href="#transferring-to-conda-forge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document intends to layout some guidelines on the transfer of
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes">conda-recipes</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-recipes">anaconda-recipes</a>
to conda-forge. These aren’t hard and fast rules and are open resonable
interpretation and reviewer judegement.</p>
<p>It is the aspiration that almost all recipes from those repos shall be
proposed for addition here, thought it may be decided that a few don’t
actually belong or should not be supported anymore.</p>
<p>When adding a package from either location, inspect the commit history
to see who has made changes to the recipe in the past. Anyone who has
touched the recipe should be pinged about it getting added here. They
should also be consulted with regards to whether the recipe needs any
tweaks before being added. Also, they should be asked if they would
like to be added as maintainers. Only if they give express permission
to be adding as a maintainer should they be added to the maintainer list.
In all cases when porting a recipe, you should add yourself as a
maintainer. Some contributors to these repos were quite prolific, but may
not be as actively engaged. If they specify they only want to be contacted
for certain recipes or none at all, please respect their wishes also add
make note of what recipes (if any) they would like to be notified for. If
they are no longer interested in any conda recipes, make that note here
as well. Before contacting anyone please consult the list in this
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/139">issue</a>
to see if that contributor has restrictions.</p>
<p>When porting make sure the recipe follows the linting specifications.
The section order should go <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">package</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">about</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extra/recipe-maintainers</span></code>. It
is recommended to add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code> section with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">number</span></code> set to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> explicitly even if the rest is unneeded. If there is no build for
Windows, make sure to add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skip:</span> <span class="pre">True</span>&#160; <span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">[win]</span></code> to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build</span></code>
section. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">about</span></code> section must have the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home</span></code> URL (verify the
URL is still correct), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">license</span></code> (verify the correct license is present),
and a one sentence (or few word) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">summary</span></code>. When specifying the version it
is strongly recommend that jinja templating be used to set the version
at the top (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;0.10.1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></code>) and then replace all
uses of the version with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">version</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. Preference should be given to
compressed source balls as opposed to version control checkouts. Make sure
all links to compressed source balls allow for easy changing of the version
(using latest is not acceptable). Also, a checksum should be included with
all compressed source balls to allow for verification of downloads.</p>
<p>It is required to add tests with all packages. These can included but are
not limited to checking libraries are installed, python imports, simple
code snippet to compile or run a basic test, command line usage (checking
help or version). It is suggested that compiled code run all tests (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">check</span></code>) to ensure it was built properly. This normally should
happen in the build.</p>
<p>It is possible, though not recommended, to include multiple recipes into a
single pull request on staged-recipes. conda-build-all is used to determine
the build order and the necessary build matrix (e.g. which python versions to
build against). From a practical perspective, there are limitations on the
continuous integration resources and also on what reviewers are able/willing
to review in a single pull request.
A large pull request with many recipes makes it more difficult to review.
If the recipes make it through these two constraints and is merged, race
conditions amongst the different feedstocks may require work by you and/or
core maintainers to restart them in such a way to build everything in a
suitable order.
None of this is to say that one can’t add multiple recipes in a single
pull request. One certainly can do this and it can work, but the
recommendation is to open a PR with one recipe first, and to ping
&#64;conda-forge/core to ask for agreement about adding one or two additional
recipes.</p>

<h2>Intended Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#intended-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maintainers’ time and CI resources are what enable conda-forge. They are as scarce as they are valuable. conda-forge has enough capacity to support releasing packages, but not developing them.</p>
<p>Publishing a package to conda-forge signals it is suitable for users not involved with development. However, publishing does not always happen error-free. Multiple commits are acceptable when debugging issues with the release process itself.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Fortunately, there are options for optimizing the development of a package.</dt>

<h2>Renaming Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes packages are misnamed. To correct the name of the package, please submit a PR into staged-recipes with the correct name. During the review process please make certain to note that the package is a rename and contact a member of conda-forge/core to remove the old feedstock (and potentially package if needed).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixing-broken-packages">
<h2>Fixing Broken Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-broken-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to remove a package from the conda-forge channel on Anaconda.org. The reasons
for this are many, but the ones that immediately come to mind are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Incorrect pinnings. This can cause the conda solver to preferentially pick up the “old” version
of the package even though you’ve bumped the build number.</li>
<li>Packages renames</li>
</ul>
<p>We prefer to not remove packages for the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Unaffected users are unable to get the broken package.</li>
<li>Unable to reverse (what if we were incorrect to remove it).</li>
<li>Loss of reproducibility (unable to create an old environment).</li>
<li>Not as community friendly (leaves no opportunity to review decision).</li>
<li>Blocks anyone from inspecting the broken packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though, we can easily address all of these by using a label for broken packages. If one simply
drops the “main” label and replaces it with “broken”. This still makes it unavailable to install
by default. However, the package remains available so as to avoid the problems listed above.</p>
<p>To get your package relabeled as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">broken</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code>, please post on the issue tracker
for your feedstock and ping <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;conda-forge/core</span></code> with this request:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Hi @conda-forge/core,

Please move my package from ``main`` to ``broken`` on the conda-forge channel on anaconda.org
because:

&lt;insert your reason&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And also post to the conda-forge gitter channel! Also please be patient with us if we do not repond
immediately :)</p>
