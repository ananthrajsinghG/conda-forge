## Agenda

### Eric
* Anaconda.org maintenance is slow. How can CF push it forward or help maintain it? What are acceptable alternatives if Anaconda.org continues to have slow maintenance and thereâ€™s no pathway for CF to contribute to the maintenance?

TO DISCUSS: Who would want access to anaconda.org? Anaconda is going to require an external contractor agreement in place that transfers all IP to Anaconda. You will also need to get a statement from your employer that states that they recognize Anaconda's IP ownership of all contributions you make to the anaconda.org code base. Without both of these documents in place we will not be able to give individuals access to the anaconda.org code base.

### Scipy Sprints
