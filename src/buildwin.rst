Building on Windows
==========================
This document presents conda-forge and conda-build information and examples
when building on Windows.

Simple CMake-Based ``bld.bat``
------------------------------
Some projects provide hooks for CMake to build the project. The following
example ``bld.bat`` file demonstrates how to build a traditional, out-of-core
build for such projects.

**CMake-based bld.bat:**

.. code-block:: bat

    setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

    :: Make a build folder and change to it.
    mkdir build
    cd build

    :: Configure using the CMakeFiles
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ^
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="%LIBRARY_PREFIX%" ^
          -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH="%LIBRARY_PREFIX%" ^
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ^
          ..
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

    :: Build!
    nmake
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

    :: Install!
    nmake install
    if errorlevel 1 exit 1

The following feedstocks are examples of this build structure deployed:

* `libping <https://github.com/conda-forge/libpng-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/bld.bat>`_
* `pugixml <https://github.com/conda-forge/pugixml-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/bld.bat>`_


Building for different VC versions
----------------------------------

On Windows, different Visual C versions have different ABI and therefore a package needs to be built for different Visual C versions. Packages are tied to the VC version that they were built with and some packages have specific requirements of the VC version. For example, python 2.7 requires ``vc 9`` and python 3.5 requires ``vc 14``.

With ``conda-build 3.x``, ``vc`` can be used as a selector when using the ``compiler`` jinja syntax.

.. code-block:: yaml

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}     # [win]

To skip building with a particular ``vc`` version, add a skip statement.

.. code-block:: yaml

    build:
        skip: true  # [vc<14]

    requirements:
      build:
        - {{ compiler('cxx') }}     # [win]
