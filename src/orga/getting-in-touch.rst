Getting in Touch
================

There are many ways to get in touch with the conda-forge community, primarily through issue trackers, mailing lists and real-time chat.

The main issue trackers that you will interact with are
* [staged-recipes](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues). You'll use staged-recipes to create a new conda package on conda-forge
* [our main docs repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues). You'll use this repo as a catch-all for issues where you're not sure where else to put them
* [our enhancement proposals repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep/issues). You'll use the enhancement proposals repo if you're interested in substantially changing the way conda-forge operates.

The main chat rooms that you'll interact with are:
* [gitter: general](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io). Our general chat room for all things conda-forge. Pretty much any question can be asked here and others in the community may be able to help.
  Move stuff to an issue tracker if your question isn't getting resolved.
* [gitter: core/private](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/core). Private chat for the @conda-forge/core team to discuss continued operations and improvements to conda-forge.
* [gitter: power pc](https://gitter.im/conda-forge-ppc64le/Lobby). Public chat room for all things related to building for power pc (IBM) systems.

Mailing lists:
* [google group: conda-forge](https://groups.google.com/g/conda-forge). The general mailing list for conda-forge.
  Sees a moderate amount of traffic, though substantially lower than the public gitter room.
* [google group: conda-forge-core](https://groups.google.com/g/conda-forge-core). The mailing list for the core team.
  Send announcements here (like meetings / CFEP stuff / votes, etc.)

Other communication methods:
* The core team is also on Keybase for security related stuff.
  If you're part of the core team and don't have access, ping someone on the core team for access.
