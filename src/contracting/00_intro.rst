Contracting Information
#######################

If you are interested in a contractual engagement to solve a specific problem
that you're facing, this page details the kinds of services that are available
to you. Conda-forge, as an entity, does not have the ability to engage in a
contractual arrangement as of now. However, there are a number of community
members that you may engage with. Anyone (individuals or companies) listed
on this page do not serve as an endorsement from the conda-forge community.

If you are interested in a service that is not listed on this page, please
reach out to us on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/),
on [gitter](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io) or via emailing
anyone on the core team directly and we will help to circulate your request
more broadly within the community.

Our intent with this page is to communicate whom you should contact and negotiate
a contract with. We hold no liability for the outcome of those negotiations or
the results of any work that is done under those terms. We will not arbitrate
any contract disputes. That is between the payer and payee to hammer out on their
own.

If you are a service provider and are interested in being added to this list,
please follow these instructions:

* TODO: Actually decide on our gatekeeping mechanism.

Open Questions (to be resolved during the PR discussion)

In theory, it could come to pass that we receive feedback (negative or positive)
about individuals / companies listed on this page. How are we supposed to handle
that? I don't think we want to become an Angie's List for people providing conda-forge
services. Or maybe we do? If so we could take a cut (single digit percentages of contract?)
to help pay for various things in the conda-forge ecosystem (cloud infrastructure,
developer time, etc.)?

Adding / Removing from our Service Providers list
=================================================

How do we gatekeep who gets added? (Do we need to gatekeep it?)

* Will we refuse adding someone to this list that asks to be added?
* Do people / companies need to meet some sort of criteria for being added?
* Can companies / people _pay_ to be included on this list? Does that even
  make sense? Do we need to care about that yet?

What are the criteria for removing someone from this list?

* The person or company listed requests removal (easy)
* The person or company submits PR requesting removal (easy)
* We receive negative feedback about a person or company listed here (hard)
