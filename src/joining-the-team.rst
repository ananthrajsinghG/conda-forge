Joining the team!
*****************

``conda-forge`` is a volunteer-driven community. We need your help! If
you are interested in helping us maintain this ecosystem, our biggest
need is help reviewing new conda packages coming in through staged-recipes.
If you would like to help us do this please ask one of the core members on
`our gitter channel <https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io>`__.
We will then reach consensus in private and let you know our decision.

Our decision will likely be "yes" but it could be "please get more involved
with the review process on staged recipes first" if we have not seen you
take much interest in the staged-recipes review process.

For transparency, our process is to have the core team "vote" on adding new
members. When we have a new member candidate, we ask the core team to vote
yes/no and give the team 24h to vote. The person will then be given merge
rights to conda-forge/staged-recipes so that they can help us review and merge
submissions more quickly!

staged-recipes responsibilities
===============================
You are the welcoming committee for new recipes coming in to the conda-forge
community! Please give new (and experienced) contributors a pleasant experience!
Generally speaking your role is as follows:

1. Keep up to date with the current best practices for conda packaging standards
2. Provide recipe review which generally means making sure that the recipe
   under review adheres to what we list on the :ref:`recipe`__ page.
3. <Other people please chime in here with what the responsibilities are supposed to be>
